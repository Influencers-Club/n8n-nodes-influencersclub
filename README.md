# n8n-nodes-influencersclub

Official n8n nodes for Influencers Club enrichment API.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository provides four official n8n nodes for Influencers Club:

- **Enrich by Email**: Takes an email address and enriches it with public social data, including possible usernames, followers, profile links, bio, and other social metrics. This is useful if you have a list of customer or subscriber emails and want to find their social presence and additional profile information.

- **Enrich by Handle**: Takes a social media handle (username) and platform, and enriches it with email (if available), followers, bio, links, and additional social metrics. This is useful if you have scraped or collected social handles and want to obtain verified emails or extra data.

- **Discovery**: Search for creators using advanced filters such as keyword, platform, audience country, follower range, engagement rate, and more. The node provides full flexibility and matches the official API documentation.

- **Find Lookalikes**: Find similar creators to a given handle on a specified platform. This is useful for building lookalike lists for outreach or audience expansion.


These nodes help marketing and growth teams enrich leads, segment audiences, sync to CRM systems, or prepare personalized outreach workflows.

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-influencersclub
```
Then, add to your n8n instance as a custom node package.


# üí• **Why your nodes do not appear yet**

Even with correct code, your package **must be loaded by n8n** correctly (custom extensions or Community Nodes). Right now:

- **You are using local env variable method**: `$env:N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS="n8n-nodes-influencersclub"`.
- The package and dist files must include **built `.js` files**, not just `.ts`.
- Your `dist/` folder must be correctly built and included in npm (which you did recently).
